# Coupon Acceptance Rates for Bars, Coffee Shops and Restaurants

## Description
This project was done to determine the acceptance rates of coupons sent out by Amazon for bars, coffee shops and restaurants. We specifically wanted to know which age and sex accepted coupons the most. We also looked at which coupons drivers with children accepted most in general and at what times they were most likely to accept them.

## Installation
Install Jupyter notebook and dataset provided to look over our results.

## How to use the information.
These insights can be used by coffee shops and bars to determine what groups they should target their marketing towards. It could also help them to understand what could be done to gain a higher acceptance rate among the groups that rejected their coupons at the highest rates.
